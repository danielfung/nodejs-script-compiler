# nodeJS
Convert CSV file to JSON file then use handlebars to merge JSON file with template

Use adv.js for CSV -> JSON -> Handlebars (JSON+Template) to make Script with the separation of files (allows you to put certain amount of output into different files)

Use basic.js for only CSV -> JSON -> Handlebars (JSON+Template) to make Script without the need of separating files on output. (keeps everything in one giant file)

This uses nodeJS - look at package.json to see library dependency
